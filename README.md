# Ecommerce assessment

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Project involves two main components, a Products array, and a Basket, we use Redux to manage context across these components, as this would be beneficial in a more fully fledged application, futher more this makes operations on the cart more usable as they are abstracted away as reducers. 

The products are displayed on a resonsive grid.
